### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data Analysis Project

### Description
This project is about using Python to explore and analyze data related to bikeshare system in three major US cities; Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
The bikeshare.py file is a menu-based script in which the data of the desired city gets imported and then analyzed in order to answer a set of interesing questions.
This script file has a couple of features like but not limited to:
1. The user can filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to get statistical information related to a specific subset of data. 
2. Enabling the user to view raw data. 

### Files used
The required files for running Python script file: 
1. washington.csv
2. new_york_city.csv
3. chicago.csv
